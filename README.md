### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME...

* I wanted to apply an opacity effect, but was struggling to do it with CSS because React hadn't rendered the DOM yet.  This was totally a new concept for me, so I had to figure out how to use a useEffect() and I combined it with a setTimeOut to get the timing correct.

```javascript  

  useEffect(() => {
    const noteContainer = document.querySelector("#root > div > div.p-container > div > div.joke-and-button-container > div > div")

    function applyOpacity() {
      noteContainer.style.transition = 'all 500ms ease-in-out';
      noteContainer.style.opacity = '1';
    }

    setTimeout(applyOpacity, 500)
          setTimeout(applyOpacity, 500)
  }, [props.state])
    
```

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED 

- [X] change in design elements
- [X] by changing the design of the project I created changes down stream that forced me to rebuild my components.  This was perfect because it forced me to create my own comoponents and practice passing down props through them.
- [X] my additional design changes eventually also created changes in how I wrote my state as well.
- [X] I eventually refactored the whole project again to give myself more practice and to improve the UX/UI.  This allowed me to build it again from scratch, without any help.
- [X] See redesigned, final project at <a href="https://tourmaline-medovik-1e81f3.netlify.app/">Dad Jokes</a>
